    <p>
        APY was launched on 9th May, 2015 by the Prime Minister. APY is open to all saving bank/post office saving bank account holders in the age group of 18 to 40 years and the contributions differ, based on pension amount chosen.  Subscribers would receive the guaranteed minimum monthly pension of Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 2,000 or Rs. 3,000 or Rs. 4,000 or Rs. 5,000 at the age of 60 years. Under APY, the monthly pension would be available to the subscriber, and after him to his spouse and after their death, the pension corpus, as accumulated at age 60 of the subscriber, would be returned to the nominee of the subscriber.

    <p>
        Under PMSBY, the risk coverage available is Rs 2 lakh for accidental death and permanent total disability, and Rs 1 lakh for permanent partial disability. Permanent total disability is defined as total and irrecoverable loss of both eyes or loss of use of both hands or feet or loss of an eyesight and loss of use of a hand or a foot. Permanent partial disability is defined as total and irrecoverable loss of an eyesight or loss of use of a hand or foot.<br>
        Accidents, any death or disability (as defined under PMSBY) resulting from natural calamities is covered under PMSBY. While death due to suicide is not covered, that from murder is covered. Partial disability without irrecoverable loss of an eyesight or loss of use of one hand or foot is not covered. Also, the family gets no insurance benefit if the subscriber commits suicide.<br>
