        The latest income declaration scheme was launched by the government as a part of the Union Budget 2016. The purpose of this scheme was to uncover the black money and bring it back to the financial system of the country. Similar to VDIS, the scheme offered an opportunity to wealth tax defaulters and income tax defaulters to disclose their income and come under the umbrella of provisions of the Income Tax Act. The scheme included declaration of the assets and paying taxes along with a penalty of 45% to avoid any litigation.

        The income declaration scheme considers a number of factors while including people or companies to withdraw litigations. Some of the factors include:<br>

        <br>Any type of undisclosed income in the form of investments, assets or any other income are covered under the jurisdiction of this scheme. This includes the income pertaining to financial year 2015-16 or previous years.
            <br>Foreign assets or income are not eligible for this scheme.
                <br>Any person or company who failed to disclose their income in the previous yearsâ€™ ITR can utilise this scheme for further disclosures. However, people who have already received notices under sections 142(1), 143(2), 148, 153(A), or 153(C) may not be eligible for disclosure under this scheme. Moreover, individuals who are under a government survey or investigation along with the people involved in cases under Black Money Act 2015, persons notified under Special Court Act 1992, and people who have cases under Indian Penal Code (IPC), Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Act 1985, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967, and Prevention of Corruption Act 1988, are not eligible for making disclosure under this scheme.
                    <br>In case of undisclosed assets, the fair market value of the asset will be calculated on the basis of market value as on 1st June 2016.
       <br>Declarations cannot claim any deductions or allowances for their disclosure. 
         <br>The income tax on disclosed assets and income will be levied at the rate of 30%. Additional penalties and cess such as Krishi Kalyan Cess and penalty at the rate of 7.5% each will also be levied on the total amount of disclosure. This makes the total penalty of 45% on the declaration.
         <br>The declarations can be made online or with Jurisdictional Principal Commissioners or any Income Tax Commissioner in the country.
        <br> As per the IDS, no scrutiny or inquiry will be conducted on individuals or companies who disclose their income and assets under the Income Tax Act or Wealth Tax Act. Assets mentioned in the disclosure are exempted from wealth tax. In addition, the amount of disclosure will not be included in the total income of the declarant in the assessment year as per the IT Act.
        <br>Another similar scheme was launched on 1st June 2016 by the name of Direct Tax Dispute Resolution Scheme. This scheme offers a way of filing tax dues to individuals who have pending application in front of Income Tax Commissioner in the country. The scheme is managed by Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).
