TIRED OF SEARCHING THE RIGHT GOVERNMENT SCHEME FOR YOU!
HAVE BEEN HUNTING THROUGH LOADS OF WEBSITES TO FIND WHICH ONE IS APPLICABLE!
STOP,NOT ANY MORE!!!
HERE IS A SOLUTION.

The aim of this project is to BUILD A WEBSITE wherein you may ENTER YOUR DETAILS INTO A FORM easily and A LIST OF SCHEMES IS DISPLAYED ACCORDING TO YOUR ELIGIBILITY.
Also there are links provided to directly access the official site of schemes.
It applies conditions based on the data you enter and filters out the schemes that you can apply.


Our small demonstrative project will distinguish different schemes  based on income criteria (that is above or below 100000) and gender basis for adults and age basis for child.

This project is made for SYNTAX error hackathon, organized by SDSLabs.
