        The scheme seeks to:<br>
•	Create scientific storage capacity with allied facilities in rural areas to help farmers in storing farm produce, processed farm produce and agricultural inputs.<br>
•	Promote grading, standardization and quality control of agricultural produce so as to improve its marketability.<br>
•	Prevent distress sale immediately after harvest by providing the facility of pledge financing and marketing credit.<br>
•	Create a robust agricultural marketing infrastructure in the country by facilitating the creation of a national system of warehouse receipts in respect of agricultural commodities stored in such warehouses.<br>
•	Revive the prospects of agricultural investments by encouraging private and cooperative sectors to invest in the creation of storage infrastructure in the country.<br>

    <p id="gby2">
        The entrepreneur is free to decide on the capacity of a warehouse. The disbursal of subsidies, however, would be restricted to a capacity of between 100 tonnes and 30,000 tonnes. Smaller-size rural warehouses of up to 50 tonnes capacity are also considered based on viability analysis/topography of the region. Rural warehouses located in hilly areas qualify if their capacity is not more than 25 tonnes.<br>
